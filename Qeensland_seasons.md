Season 1: The Wet Season (Summer)
This season is characterized by high heat, oppressive humidity, and heavy monsoonal rainfall, creating a tropical, high-growth but high-risk environment.


Time Period: December 2024 - February 2025


Temperature:


Daytime: Consistently hot, averaging 30-35°C (86-95°F) in most regions.


Nighttime: Warm and sticky, rarely dropping below 24°C (75°F).


Conditions: The "feels like" temperature is often much higher due to the humidity. Heat stress on crops and livestock is a major concern.


Rainfall:


Amount: This is the monsoon season. Expect heavy, intense downpours and dramatic thunderstorms, often in the afternoon. Monthly totals frequently exceed 200-300 mm (8-12 inches), especially in the north.


Conditions: High risk of flash flooding. The tropical north is on high alert for cyclones during this period, which can bring destructive winds and extreme rainfall (over 500mm in a single event).

Humidity:


Level: Extremely high. Relative humidity is consistently 70-85%.


Conditions: The air feels heavy and oppressive. These conditions are ideal for the rapid growth of fungal diseases on plants (e.g., mildew, blight).


Altitude:


Effect: Altitude is a fixed property of the location, but its effect is pronounced this season.


Coastal Lowlands (e.g., around Cairns, 0-50m): Experience the full force of the heat and humidity.


Atherton Tablelands (west of Cairns, 600-900m): The altitude provides some relief, with temperatures a few degrees cooler, making it a vital agricultural area for crops that prefer slightly milder conditions.


Soil:


Condition: Saturated and often waterlogged.


Description: The ground cannot absorb the intense rainfall fast enough. Fields can be covered in standing water for days. This leads to a high risk of root rot, prevents farm machinery from accessing fields, and causes vital nutrients to be washed away (leaching).


Types: Heavy clay soils are particularly problematic, holding water and becoming a sticky, unworkable mud. Loamy soils drain better but can still be overwhelmed.




Season 2: The Dry Season (Winter)

This season is famous for its pleasant, mild weather with clear blue skies and very little rain, creating a stable but irrigation-dependent farming environment.


Time Period: June 2025 - August 2025

Temperature:

Daytime: Warm and very pleasant, averaging 22-26°C (72-79°F).


Nighttime: Cool and crisp. Can drop to 10-15°C (50-59°F) along the coast, and much colder inland.


Conditions: In southern inland areas like the Darling Downs, nighttime temperatures can drop near freezing, bringing a risk of light frost.


Rainfall:


Amount: Very little to none. It's common for weeks to pass without any significant rain. Monthly totals are often below 20 mm (less than 1 inch).


Conditions: Drought is the primary concern. Water management, irrigation scheduling, and sourcing water are the biggest challenges.


Humidity:


Level: Low and comfortable. Relative humidity is typically 40-55%.


Conditions: The low humidity reduces pressure from fungal diseases but increases the rate at which plants lose water (evapotranspiration), making them thirstier.


Altitude:


Effect: The impact of altitude is felt more through lower nighttime temperatures.


Southern Downs (e.g., around Stanthorpe, ~800m): This high-altitude region is known as the "Granite Belt" and regularly experiences frost in winter, allowing it to grow stone fruits like apples and pears that require winter chilling.


Soil:


Condition:
Dry, compacted, and hard.


Description: Without rain, the soil becomes very hard. Farmers must rely entirely on irrigation. Water evaporates quickly from the surface.


Types:
Clay soils, which were waterlogged mud in the summer, can now bake into a concrete-like hardpan that cracks open. Loamy and sandy soils will require frequent, efficient watering as they do not retain moisture for long.
