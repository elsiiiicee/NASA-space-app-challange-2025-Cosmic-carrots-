BRIEF DESCRIPTION
The core of this game is the Data Card system. In each round, the player draws cards that are simplified NASA data which inform the player about the conditions of his crop. Then the player spends their money interventions to react to the opportunities and threats, but keeping in mind that the game has four round so he has to budget his money.


THE GAMEPLAY

PHASE ONE 
1--Firstly the player is going to be greeted by a map with certain location each with its different stats (they are going to be displayed as cards) and he is going to choose.
2--Then the game is going to randomly assign a season (spring summer autumn winter) and year for the player to play on the location which he chose.
The Game is going to present a "Seasonal Briefing" which is going to contain; 
A- Location and season Stats (to help the player shoos a suitable crop),
B- Water Outlook (Uses historical data to give stats like "Average historical soil moisture" and "Historical chance of drought."),
C- Flood Risk (Pulls from the Floods Data Pathfinder to display the "Historical probability of flood events" for that season and location.)
D- 
3--Crop selection the player will choose form a list of crops, each one of them has clear needs ( high water heat, humidity ect ect) , some crops are harder to grow but more rewarding if you do.

PHASE TWO 
At the start of each 3-4 week round, the player is dealt 3-4 cards ( the number of cards depends on the dificulty). Each card represents and insight form a specific NASA tool and forecasts a condition for the upcoming round.
After the player makes their purchases, the round is simulated. The game calculates the outcome based on their choices versus the events that occurred.

PHASE THREE 


The final score is a Sustainability Index composed of three parts:

Yield & Profit: How much of your crop did you successfully harvest and how much money do you have left?

Resource Efficiency: How effectively did you use water and nutrients? Players who chose targeted, precise interventions based on the Data Cards will score higher.

Environmental Health: Did you overuse fertilizer leading to runoff? Did your farm survive the season without degrading the soil?

After each round, a summary screen explains why the player got their score. For example: "Your Crop-CASMA data card prompted you to buy Precision Irrigation, saving you $50 and 20% of your water budget. Your Environmental Score has increased!" This direct feedback loop is crucial for learning.




Put ideas here!!!!
- When we present this project we are going to say that we are goign to do three levels for different group ages , one that is easy for children which will contain very little actual data but will only give a simplified overview, then a medium which is the one we are doing , and then a hard which will have a lot of data that are no at all simplified.
